# AC-DIMMER
Install the library 
https://github.com/RobotDynOfficial/RBDDimmer

Code :
For Arduino Uno
Pin 2 : zero crossing
Pin 3 : PWM
Through Pwm the Light will be dimming (recommend use incandescent light bulb ) 

On AC side:
Common neutral wire of LOAD and AC input voltage and connect it to NEUTRAL
Connect AC Input Phase wire to INPUT
Connect Bulb Phase wire to OUTPUT
